Binaries are build from the RTKLIB library https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB/tree/rtklib_2.4.3.
This repo is based on the binaries that are build for Windows at:  https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB_bin/tree/rtklib_2.4.3
This is spesifically the standalone command line user interface (CUI) applications: rtkconv, and rnx2rtkp. 

Unfortunately the latter versions of RTKlib is poorly documentet, and not much examples exist that uses the library functions directly. There are however examples that use the CUI tool for varius GNSS processing tasks such as http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2352452 and http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2616816 . The RTKLIB manual for 2.4.2 is also of use: http://www.rtklib.com/prog/manual_2.4.2.pdf
